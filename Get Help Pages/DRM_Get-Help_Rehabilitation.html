        <p class="trigger-content"><strong>Overcoming Destructive Habits</strong></p>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p>Drug and alcohol abuse, poor financial decisions, unhealthy relationships and other destructive habits can cause anyone to think a “new life” is out of reach. Our goal is to see New Life Program participants like you transformed by overcoming destructive habits. By immersing yourself in the program, you will receive the help you need and experience victory over life-draining behaviors.</p>
            </div>
        <p class="trigger-content"><strong>Maintaining Healthy Community</strong></p>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p>In the New Life Program, you will learn to build and maintain healthy community relationships. These relationships encourage accountability and foster continued productive participation in society</p>
            </div>
        <p class="trigger-content"><strong>Maintaining Sustainable, Full-Time Employment or Equivalent Income</strong></p>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p>As you advance through the program and pursue financial goals you set alongside Mission staff, you will eventually obtain sustainable, full-time employment or equivalent income.</p>
