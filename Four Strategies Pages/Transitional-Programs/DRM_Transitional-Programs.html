    <h5>For working individuals and families experiencing homelessness, finding a safe and affordable place to live while they transition out of poverty can be a challenge.</h5>
    <p>The STAR Transitional Program helps people who are homeless, despite having a job, find a safe and encouraging community where they can transition out of homelessness and into a sustainable, self-sufficient life. At the Mission’s largest facility, The Crossing, individuals and families are able to live in a safe and encouraging community away from the substance abuse prevalent in hotels and on the streets.</p>

    <h2 class="rtecenter">Making the Transition</h2>
    <p>We help STAR Transitional Program participants through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Case management</li>
        <li>Life-skills training</li>
        <li>Financial management training</li>
        <li>Cultivating healthy community relationships</li>
        <li>Youth development programs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unlike the New Life Program, the STAR Program uses program fees to encourage personal and financial responsibility. At least one STAR Transitional Program adult must have a minimum income of $800/month for individuals and $1,000/month for families.</p>
